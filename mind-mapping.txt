01 - create JSON object for questions
02 - start creating HTML markup
03 - add dummy data
04 - create the styling
05 - fetch number of questions from JSON object
06 - show questions count + questions category
07 - show the number of bullets depend on questions count
10 - fetch the questions from the JSON object
11 - show first question
12 - check answer and hide its question and show the next
14 - add class on bullets after answering the question

08 - set a number for the right and wrong answers
09 - create countdown timer
13 - when time ends mark the question as wrong and show the next question

Ideas
- many JSON objects and choose language
- add many questions and choose only 10 randomly
- randomize answers (shuffle function)
